  <p class="carfont">Mazda RX7</p>
  <p class="carparagraph">
   From 1978 until 2002, Mazda produced and sold the Mazda RX-7, a front-engine/ rear-wheel drive sports car with a rotary engine. All three incarnations of the Mazda RX-7 used the same small, light Wankel rotary engine.
<br><br>
The SA (early) and FB (late) models of the RX-7 were two-seater, two-door hatchback coupés. It had a rotary engine with a 12A carburetor and, in later years, the choice of a 13B with electronic fuel injection.
<br><br>
    The second-generation RX-7, also known as the FD, was available as a 2+2-seater coupé with a very small number of 2-seater options. This had a 13B REW engine that was sequentially turbocharged.

   <p  style="text-align:left;" class="carparagraph">
 Performance Potential
  <br>  <br>
One of the primary reasons enthusiasts choose to modify the Mazda RX-7 is its incredible performance potential. The RX-7 is renowned for its lightweight chassis and the iconic rotary engine, which delivers a unique driving experience. However, with modifications, you can unlock even more power and handling capabilities. Upgrading components like the turbocharger, exhaust system, suspension, and brakes can significantly improve the car's performance, making it a formidable contender on both the street and the track.
  <br>  <br>  <br>
Aftermarket Support
  <br>  <br>
Another key factor that makes modifying the Mazda RX-7 an attractive proposition is the robust aftermarket support for this iconic car. Over the years, a thriving community of enthusiasts, tuners, and parts manufacturers has developed around the RX-7. This means that a wide range of performance parts and accessories are readily available, making it easier to find the perfect components to suit your customization goals. From bolt-on upgrades to complete engine swaps, the RX-7's aftermarket ecosystem offers an impressive array of options.
  <br>  <br>  <br>
Design Elegance
  <br>  <br>
The Mazda RX-7's design is another compelling reason to modify it. With its sleek, aerodynamic lines, distinctive pop-up headlights, and timeless styling, the RX-7 is a canvas for customization. Many enthusiasts embark on projects to enhance the car's exterior, whether through subtle body kits, custom paint jobs, or aggressive aero components. The beauty of the RX-7's design is that it provides a platform for personal expression, allowing owners to make their cars truly unique.
  <br>  <br>  <br>
Motorsports Success and History
  <br>  <br>
The RX-7's rich motorsports history is a testament to its performance capabilities. This car has a track record of success in various racing series, including IMSA, SCCA, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. For enthusiasts, modifying an RX-7 can be a way to pay homage to its motorsports legacy while taking their own driving skills to new heights. Upgrades can help transform the RX-7 into a competitive track machine, ready to tackle autocross events or even drift competitions.
  <br>  <br>  <br>
Driving Experience
  <br>  <br>
Above all, the driving experience is at the heart of why enthusiasts modify Mazda RX-7s. The rotary engine's unique characteristics, such as high-revving power delivery and a distinctive exhaust note, create an exhilarating driving experience that is hard to replicate. Modifying an RX-7 can tailor this experience to your preferences. Whether you desire more power, precise handling, or a unique sound, the modifications can help you create the perfect driving experience that suits your style.
  <br>  <br>  <br>

Modifying a Mazda RX-7 is a popular choice for automotive enthusiasts because of its untapped performance potential, strong aftermarket support, elegant design, motorsports success, and unparalleled driving experience. Whether you are seeking more power on the track, a personalized exterior appearance, or a deeper connection to the car's rich history, the RX-7 offers a perfect platform for customization. The RX-7 represents more than just a car; it's a piece of automotive history that can be sculpted into a personalized masterpiece, all while paying homage to its racing pedigree and rotary heritage.

   <p  style="text-align:left;" class="carparagraph">
  
	   First Generation (SA/FB) RX-7
<br><br>
Engine Swap: The first-generation RX-7 came equipped with the rotary engine, but many owners opt for engine swaps to improve performance and reliability. Popular swaps include the Mazda 13B-REW, sourced from later RX-7s, and the LS-series V8 engines for a significant power boost.
<br><br>
Suspension Upgrades: Upgrading the suspension components with high-quality shocks, struts, and sway bars can significantly improve the car's handling and cornering ability. Lowering springs or coilovers are also popular choices to enhance both aesthetics and performance.
<br><br>
Wider Wheels and Tires: Replacing the stock wheels with wider, lightweight alloy wheels and upgrading to stickier performance tires helps enhance grip and improve the car's overall balance.
