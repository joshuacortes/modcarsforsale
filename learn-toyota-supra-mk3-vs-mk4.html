   <h2>Stock Motor</h2>
    <p class="posttext">
     The Toyota Supra is an iconic sports car that has captured the hearts of automotive enthusiasts for generations. In this article, we will delve into the world of the Supra, comparing the stock motors of the third-generation (Mk3) and fourth-generation (Mk4) models. By examining their engines' specifications and performance characteristics, we can gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of this legendary sports car.
<br><br><br>
Toyota Supra Mk3:<br><br>
The third-generation Toyota Supra, produced from 1986 to 1992, came equipped with a range of engine options. The most notable powerplant in the Mk3 Supra lineup was the 7M-GE, a naturally aspirated 3.0-liter inline-six engine. This engine delivered respectable performance figures for its time, producing around 200 horsepower and 196 lb-ft of torque.
<br><br>
The 7M-GE engine featured Toyota's advanced technologies, including electronic fuel injection and a double overhead camshaft design. While it offered smooth power delivery and decent acceleration, the Mk3 Supra was often lauded more for its handling capabilities than its outright power.
<br><br><br>
Toyota Supra Mk4:<br><br>
The fourth-generation Toyota Supra, produced from 1993 to 2002, is widely regarded as the pinnacle of the Supra lineage. The Mk4 Supra featured an array of engine options, but the most renowned powerplant was the legendary 2JZ-GTE, a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine.
<br><br>
The 2JZ-GTE engine became a legend in the automotive world, delivering exhilarating performance. In its stock form, it produced around 320 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque. However, the engine's robust design and excellent tuning potential allowed for easy modifications and substantial power gains, making it a favorite among aftermarket tuners.
<br><br>
The 2JZ-GTE engine featured an advanced sequential twin-turbo system, which eliminated turbo lag and provided seamless power delivery across the rev range. Combined with the Supra's rear-wheel drive configuration, the Mk4 Supra became synonymous with blistering acceleration and incredible straight-line speed.
<br><br><br>
Performance Comparison:<br><br>
In terms of performance, there is a significant disparity between the Mk3 and Mk4 Supra. The Mk4 Supra's 2JZ-GTE engine, with its twin-turbo setup, outshines the Mk3 Supra's naturally aspirated 7M-GE engine in terms of horsepower and torque. The 2JZ-GTE's robust construction, paired with its ability to handle increased boost pressure, allows for tremendous power potential with aftermarket modifications.
<br><br>
The Mk4 Supra's acceleration and overall performance are in a league of their own, allowing the car to achieve impressive quarter-mile times and become an icon in the world of street racing and performance tuning. The Mk3 Supra, while respectable for its era, did not possess the same level of power and performance as its successor.
<br><br><br>
Legacy and Aftermarket Potential:<br><br>
The Mk4 Supra's 2JZ-GTE engine has become legendary in the automotive world, with enthusiasts appreciating its reliability, durability, and tuning potential. Its robust design has allowed the engine to handle massive horsepower figures, making it a favorite among performance enthusiasts and tuners worldwide.
<br><br>
While the Mk3 Supra's engine may not have achieved the same level of aftermarket fame as the 2JZ-GTE, it still offers a solid foundation for enthusiasts seeking performance upgrades. With the right modifications, the 7M-GE engine can be enhanced to deliver more power and improved performance.
<br><br><br>

Comparing the stock motors of the Toyota Supra Mk3 and Mk4 reveals a significant leap in power and performance with the arrival of the legendary 2JZ-GTE engine in the Mk4 Supra. The 2JZ-GTE's twin-turbo setup and robust design catapulted the Mk4 Supra into the performance car hall of fame, delivering exhilarating acceleration and becoming a tuner's dream.
<br><br>
While the Mk3 Supra's stock motor may not possess the same level of power, it still offers a solid platform for enthusiasts seeking an iconic sports car with potential for improvement through modifications.
