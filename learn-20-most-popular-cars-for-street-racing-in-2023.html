    <p class="posttext">
Although street racing is becoming more popular, it is still not very prevalent. Street racing is still a very uncommon traffic crime, despite a considerable spike in penalties over the past year. More often than street racing, drivers receive penalties for offenses like at-fault collisions, speeding, and DUIs.
      <br><br>
      The popularity of street racing remains unabated, and these cars are a popular choice because of their excellent handling and affordable tunability.
      <br><br>
      In terms of street racing, a few sports vehicles have become the most popular options. These vehicles typically have one or more characteristics that make them perfect for the punishing conditions of street racing. Some of these include the simplicity and low cost of tuning the vehicle to improve performance above stock. Others are low maintenance costs, affordability, and naturally, vehicles with exceptional handling qualities.
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Toyota Supra MK IV</b>
      <br><br>
      The easily upgradeable power output of the twin turbo Toyota Supra appeals to many people. With a free flowing intake and exhaust system paired with an aftermarket boost controller, the factory turbos are capable of producing between 450 and 500 horsepower.
      <br><br>
      Despite not being very light, the Mark IV Toyota Supra was significantly lighter than the preceding model. It helped that the hood, targa top, front crossmember, oil pan, and upper A-arms were made of aluminum. The same could be said for magnesium steering wheel, plastic gas cap, and rear spoiler with gas injection. The MK IV Supra was at least 45 kgs (100 lbs) lighter than the previous model while having more amenities including dual airbags, traction control, larger brakes, larger wheels, and larger tires.
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Honda Civic SI</b>
      <br><br>
      On April 6, 2017, the 2017 Honda Civic Si (tenth generation) was unveiled via a live YouTube broadcast. A more potent variant of the 1.5 L turbocharged four-cylinder engine found in other Civics powers this model. In the United States, it became available for purchase in May 2017 as a coupe or sedan. It is based on the sedan and coupe versions of the 10th generation Honda Civic Sport Touring. 205 horsepower (153 kW) and 192 lb-ft (260 Nm) of torque are produced by a direct-injected 1.5 liter turbocharged engine. Maximum torque is accessible at low speeds between 2,100 and 5,000 rpm, while peak horsepower is attained at 5700 rpm. Compared to the normal Civic, the suspension has been adjusted and made stiffer.
      <br><br>
      The body features significantly improved chassis and drivetrain parts, such as a helical limited-slip differential, sport-tuned suspension, an adaptive damper system, larger front brake rotors (12.3 in [310 mm]), and wider 235/40 R18 tires.
      
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX</b>
      <br><br>
      The front spoiler of the car had a large opening in it, and the large intercooler for the turbo was visible. Two fog lights and an additional set of brake cooling vents were located on its sides. The only thing supported on the black mesh grille was the Mitsubishi logo. There was an air-extraction vent on the hood that wasn't just for show. It worked properly. Mitsubishi added a row of tiny, shark-like fins to the back of the roof to improve aerodynamics. To aid improve the downforce on the back axle, an adjustable system was included in the large rear spoiler on the trunk.
      <br><br>
      On several Lance Evolution versions, the same 4G63 engine was found under the hood, but for the IXth edition, a variable valve timing system known as MIVEC was added. The other trim levels only had 5-speed gearboxes, with the exception of the MR variant, which featured a 6-speed manual transmission. All of the cars had all-wheel drive.
      
      
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Ford Mustang</b>
      <br><br>
      For the 2005 to 2010 production years, the GT featured a 4.6 L SOHC three-valve Modular V8 with variable camshaft timing (VCT) that produced 300 hp, while the base model used a 210 hp (157 kW; 213 PS) cast-iron block 4.0 L SOHC V6 (224 kW; 304 PS). The spring 2009 release of the 2010 model year Mustang included a revised appearance, which incorporated sequential LED taillights, and a lower drag coefficient.
      <br><br>
      For 2011, the gearbox options included the Getrag-Ford 6R80 six-speed automatic based on the ZF 6HP26 transmission, licensed for manufacturing by Ford, and the Getrag-Ford MT82 six-speed manual. The engines were also upgraded. The traditional hydraulic power steering was replaced by electric power steering. Compared to the previous model, the new 3.72 L (227 cu in) aluminum block V6 engine weighed 40 lb (18 kg) less. Twin independent variable cam timing (TiVCT) with 24 valves allowed it to produce 280 lb-ft (380 Nm) of torque and 305 horsepower (227 kW; 309 PS) through its 24 valves.
      <br><br>
      Ford introduced an update to the Mustang series in the second quarter of 2012 as an early 2013 model. The new 5.8 L supercharged V8 in the Shelby GT500 produced 662 horsepower (494 kW; 671 PS). A six-speed manual transmission was included with the Shelby and Boss engines. The grille and air intakes from the 2010â€“2012 GT500s were included into the GT and V6 models' updated appearance. On all trim levels, a black decorative panel was added to the decklid. The GT's 5.0-liter V8 now has 420 horsepower, up from 412 horsepower (307 kW; 418 PS) (313 kW; 426 PS).
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Subaru WRX</b>
      <br><br>
      A 2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four cylinder engine powers the WRX. There are two transmission options for its 271 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque: a conventional six-speed manual or a continuously variable automatic (CVT). Every WRX features all-wheel drive as per tradition. There are three distinct drive-mode options available for those who choose the automatic transmission, which is similarly managed by paddle shifters on the steering wheel. Adaptive dampers are also included with the GT model that only has an automatic transmission.
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Toyota 86</b>
      <br><br>
      The rear-drive design and excellent transmission options of the 86 help it succeed. Its 2.0-liter flat-four engine, which comes from a Subaru, is noticeably less enjoyable. It is loud, gruff, and has an unusual decrease in torque midway through the rpm range. With the manual transmission, we were still able to reach 60 mph in 6.2 seconds.
      <br><br>
      The 86's direct, quick-ratio steering and appealing small-diameter steering wheel are more enjoyable to discuss and use. The car's direction is immediately altered by steering inputs, and the body maintains its flatness during turns and rapid transitions. Overeager drivers experience controllable oversteer, which is the sensation that the car's tail is sliding out from under them, at first due to the neutral chassis balance, which causes understeer as the front tires slip toward the outside edge of the road. If you kill the stability control first, applying throttle in this scenario can hang the tail way out in a significant drift for the skillful and daring.
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Volkswagen Golf GTI</b>
      <br><br>
      The S, SE, and Autobahn trim levels for the 2022 Volkswagen GTI are available. Front-wheel drive and a 241-horsepower turbocharged engine are standard across all variants; a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission with paddle shifters is optional and costs $800.
      <br><br>
      The turbocharged four-cylinder engine that powers the GTI's new generation is still present, but it now produces 241 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque instead of 228 and 258 in the 2021 model. The standard six-speed manual transmission is a terrific match for the engine; it is simple to operate and has a firm clutch feel. Acceleration comes on strongly as soon as you press the gas pedal, and accelerating up to higher speeds is seamless. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic shifts gears with precision for individuals who would rather do less labor.
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Nissan 350Z</b>
      <br><br>
      The 350Z coupÃ© was introduced on July 20, 2002, in the United States, and was offered in 5 trim packages: "350Z" (Base), "Enthusiast," "Performance," "Touring," and "Track." The 350Z coupÃ© was sold in Japan at reorganized Nissan Japanese dealerships known as Nissan Blue Stage and on August 20, 2002, in Japan.
      <br><br>
      The 350Z saw a slight revision once again for the 2007 model year. A new VQ35HR V6 was installed in place of the VQ35DE V6. Using the updated SAE certified power benchmark, it generated 306 bhp (310 PS; 228 kW) at 6800 rpm and 268 lb-ft (363 Nm) of torque at 4800 rpm[8]. The redline of the VQ35HR was increased to 7500 rpm, and it had higher torque throughout the rev range. To fit the additional deck height of the new VQ35HR, the bonnet was modified with a bulge reminiscent of the original 240Z. Trim levels were reduced to 350Z (base), Enthusiast, Touring, Grand Touring, and NISMO in the U.S., although they stayed the same in Europe. In time for the 2007 model year, Bluetooth was included.
      
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Chevrolet Corvette C6</b>
      <br><br>
      With the debut of the LS3 engine in 2008, the C6 received a significant facelift. The 6.2-liter LS3 engine, which replaced the LS2, produced 436 horsepower and 428 lb-ft of torque when equipped with the optional dual-mode exhaust system.
      <br><br>
      The ZR1 C6 produces 604 lb-ft of torque and 638 horsepower. Other improvements include model-specific gearing, magnetic selective ride control, carbon-ceramic brakes, and a variety of carbon fiber body panels. With a top speed of 205 mph, it was GM's most potent and swiftest vehicle at the time of its release. A six-speed manual transmission was the only available option, same like the Z06.
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>BMW M2</b>
      <br><br>
      The 3.0-liter N55B30T0 turbocharged straight-six engine that powers the M2 is rated at 465 Nm (343 lb-ft) between 1,450 and 4,750 rpm and 272 kW (365 horsepower) at 6,500 rpm. The M2 includes lighter front and rear suspension parts made of aluminum and strengthened pistons. A 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission are both options for the M2. 0-100 km/h acceleration times for vehicles with manual transmissions are 4.5 seconds, whereas they are 4.3 seconds for vehicles with 7-speed dual clutch transmissions.
      
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat</b>
      <br><br>
      Most recent models include a supercharged V-8 engine that generates at least 717 horsepower. A Redeye model will increase horsepower to 797, while the Jailbreak package will increase it to an astonishing 807 horsepower.
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Nissan GT-R</b>
      <br><br>
      Hidden behind the hood, despite the fact that its exterior is nothing short of amazing, a massive 480 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of raw torque are produced by a 3,799 cc (3.8 liter: 231.8 cu) twin-turbo V6 VR38dett engine. The car can accelerate from 0 to 60 MPH in as little as 3 seconds flat despite having a curb weight of about 3850 lbs thanks to the supercharged beast. As the GT-R soars down the road and reaches a top speed of 195 MPH, the vr38dett keeps its strength.
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>BMW 3-Series (E46)</b>
      <br><br>
      Base models come with a 1.8-liter engine with 115 horsepower, known as the 316i. The 318i, which provided a 2.0-liter engine with 143 horsepower, was the most widely used model. Since the first version, it was a BMW's first 2.0-liter engine with four cylinders. The most powerful model featured a 3.0-liter engine with 231 horsepower that could be paired with a 6-speed manual transmission and either a rear- or all-wheel drive system. A 5-speed automatic transmission was offered with each model.
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Honda S2000</b>
      <br><br>
      The S2000 is powered by a 2.2L L4 DOHC 16-valve engine with a 6 speed manual transmission, producing 237 horsepower at 7800 rpm. The 2009 Honda S2000 Base weights 1301 kg and has a 152-liter load capacity. The 2009 Honda S2000 Base incorporates stability control, traction control, and an anti-lock brake system for ride assistance (ABS).
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Porsche 911 GT3 RS</b>
      <br><br>
      In the GT3 and GT3 Touring, a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six engine cranks up to its redline at 9000 rpm while churning out 502 horsepower. The Porsche GT3 RS can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3 seconds flat thanks to these tweaks and other performance-improving changes, which is 0.2 seconds faster than the base GT3 car.
      
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Acura RSX-S</b>
      <br><br>
      The RSX Type-S has a naturally aspirated inline four-cylinder petrol engine with the engine code Honda K20A-series, with a top speed of 145 mph (233 km/h) and a curb weight of 2778 lbs (1260 kg).
