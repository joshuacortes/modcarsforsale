<br><br>
  <p class="carfont">INFINITI G35</p>
  <p style="text-align:left;" class="carparagraph">
  The third-generation G (V35) was debuted in June 2001 and made available in North America on March 12, 2002, as the G35 for the 2003 model year. The Infiniti G35 had nothing in common with the G20 and carried on the legacy of the first-generation Infiniti M and J30, both of which were RWD cars that shared their drivetrain with modern Nissan Zs.
  </p>
  
  <br>
   <p class="carfont">Layout & Body Style</p>
  <p style="text-align:left;" class="carparagraph">
  Powered by the popular VQ35DE engine, the G35 has a front-midship engine and rear-wheel drive (all-wheel drive is an option for the G35x sedan). This configuration results in a 52 percent front/48 percent rear weight distribution. Both body types are offered with a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic (JATCO RE5R05A) Tiptronic transmission, albeit the AWD sedan is the only avilable in automatic.

   <p  style="text-align:left;" class="carparagraph">
   Performance Upgrades

 <br> <br>One of the primary reasons for modifying an Infiniti G35 is to enhance its performance. The G35 comes with a potent V6 engine that provides a solid foundation for power upgrades. Enthusiasts can opt for a variety of modifications to boost horsepower and torque, such as installing cold air intakes, exhaust systems, and ECU tuning. Many have swapped the engine for the formidable VQ35DE or VQ35HR for even more power. These enhancements can significantly improve the car's acceleration and overall driving experience, making it a worthy contender on the road or the track.

 <br> <br> <br>Aftermarket Support

 <br> <br>The aftermarket support for the Infiniti G35 is extensive, with a plethora of companies offering high-quality performance parts and accessories. This support enables owners to customize their G35s to suit their individual preferences. From suspension upgrades, coilovers, and brake kits to turbochargers and superchargers, the options are nearly limitless. Whether you are seeking a modest daily driver or a track-ready monster, the G35's aftermarket support can help you achieve your desired results.

 <br> <br> <br>Design Upgrades

 <br> <br>Modifying a G35 isn't just about performance; it's also an opportunity to enhance its aesthetics. Aftermarket body kits, carbon fiber accents, custom wheels, and paint jobs allow owners to express their unique sense of style. The G35's timeless design means that even subtle modifications can have a significant impact on its appearance. Drivers can turn heads with a tastefully modified G35 that combines both form and function.

 <br> <br> <br>Motorsports Success

 <br> <br>The Infiniti G35 has had its fair share of success in motorsports, particularly in drifting competitions. Drivers like Chris Forsberg have proven the capabilities of the G35 by clinching championships in Formula Drift. Its well-balanced chassis and powerful V6 engine make it an excellent choice for those looking to participate in motorsport events. Many G35 owners take inspiration from these successes and modify their vehicles to compete in amateur and professional racing events, highlighting the car's true potential.

 <br> <br> <br>Driving Expression

 <br> <br>A modified Infiniti G35 offers a unique driving experience that combines luxury and performance. The thrill of piloting a customized G35 down a winding road or a racetrack can be genuinely exhilarating. Whether you're drawn to the symphony of the exhaust note or the feeling of precision and control, the G35 provides a canvas for drivers to express themselves and experience the joy of spirited driving.
 <br> <br> <br>

Modifying an Infiniti G35 allows enthusiasts to unlock its full potential in terms of performance, design, and personal expression. With a strong aftermarket support system, the G35 is a versatile platform that can cater to various tastes and preferences. Its motorsports success further underscores its capabilities, while the unique driving experience it offers is a testament to the car's enduring appeal. Whether you seek a daily driver with a touch of luxury or a track-focused performance machine, the Infiniti G35 is a fantastic choice for customization and personalization.

  <h2 class="carfont">COMMON INFINITI G35 MODIFICATIONS:</h2>
  
  <div style="width:90%;">
   <p  style="text-align:left;" class="carparagraph">
 
	   Cold Air Intake
<br><br>One of the most popular and accessible modifications for the G35 is the installation of a cold air intake (CAI). A CAI replaces the factory airbox and filter, allowing the engine to breathe cooler air and provide a noticeable increase in horsepower and torque. Not only does it boost performance, but it also enhances the engine's growl, providing a more aggressive and exciting sound.

<br><br><br>Exhaust System
<br><br>Upgrading the exhaust system is another common modification that many G35 owners opt for. Aftermarket exhaust systems, such as cat-back or axle-back systems, improve exhaust flow, enhance engine response, and provide a more thrilling exhaust note. The G35's V6 engine can sound even more impressive with the right exhaust system, giving the car a unique auditory character.

<br><br><br>Suspension Upgrades
<br><br>To improve handling and the car's overall driving dynamics, many G35 owners invest in suspension upgrades. Lowering springs, coilovers, and sway bars can help lower the car's center of gravity, reduce body roll, and enhance cornering performance. A well-tuned suspension modification can transform the G35 into a true driver's car, providing better control and responsiveness.

<br><br><br>Wheels and Tires
<br><br>Upgrading the wheels and tires on a G35 can offer both aesthetic and performance benefits. Custom wheels not only change the car's appearance but can also reduce unsprung weight and improve handling. Additionally, fitting grippier performance tires can increase traction and make the G35 feel even more planted on the road, improving overall performance.

<br><br><br>ECU Tuning
<br><br>For those seeking significant performance gains, electronic control unit (ECU) tuning is a popular modification. ECU tuning can optimize engine parameters, including fuel delivery, ignition timing, and more, to extract additional power and torque from the V6 engine. This modification often requires professional tuning to ensure safe and reliable performance gains.

<br><br><br>Body Kits and Aerodynamics
<br><br>Enhancing the G35's aesthetics is a common objective for many owners. Aftermarket body kits, front splitters, rear spoilers, and carbon fiber accents can transform the G35's appearance into a more aggressive and unique design. These modifications can provide a personalized touch while also improving aerodynamics and downforce.

<br><br><br>Brakes
<br><br>Upgrading the braking system is essential for those looking to improve the G35's performance capabilities. Aftermarket brake kits with larger rotors and high-performance brake pads can enhance stopping power and reduce brake fade during spirited driving. This modification is especially crucial for G35 owners who plan to push their cars to the limit on the track.

<br><br><br>

The Infiniti G35 is a versatile platform for modification, and its popularity among enthusiasts stems from its potential for both performance and aesthetic enhancements. From simple and affordable modifications like cold air intakes and exhaust systems to more advanced changes such as ECU tuning and suspension upgrades, G35 owners have a wide array of options to personalize their vehicles. These modifications not only improve the car's performance but also allow owners to express their unique tastes and preferences, making the Infiniti G35 a true enthusiast's dream.
